    <strong>Wolf Game: Multi-Agent Cooperation and Adversarial System Based on ERNIE LLM</strong><br>
    Team Leader | Jan 2025 – May 2025<br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> Software Copyright; National Third Prize, China Undergraduate Service Outsourcing Innovation & Entrepreneurship Competition<br>
    <em>Description:</em> Built an intelligent game platform for the Werewolf scenario using ERNIE large language model and the Swarm multi-agent framework. The system integrates natural language understanding with strategic decision-making to enable cooperation and confrontation among AI agents. I led the FastAPI backend architecture and strategy engine development, implemented a dual-layer agent persona design and complete game rule system, and participated in project management and technical decision-making, promoting AI applications in complex social reasoning environments.

    <strong>Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Robot System</strong><br>
    Robot Application Competition (Intelligent Driving) | Team Leader | Mar 2025 – Jul 2025<br>
    <em>Description:</em> Developed visual perception and robot motion algorithms for autonomous driving tasks in an offline competition environment. The robot adopted a vision-based solution to accomplish lane following, pedestrian crossing detection, traffic light recognition, obstacle avoidance, and voice prompt functions for intelligent driving scenarios.<br>
    <em>My Role:</em> The team employed a vision-based autonomous driving approach integrating camera inputs with deep learning models to enable autonomous navigation and event response on structured tracks. I was primarily responsible for visual algorithm learning and parameter tuning. This included understanding the fundamental principles of lane detection, pedestrian crossing recognition, and traffic light detection modules, and optimizing model thresholds, detection stability, and navigation behavior through systematic parameter adjustment and multiple experimental iterations. These efforts improved the robustness and task completion rate of the robot under different track conditions.

    <strong>NeuroTrip: Neuro-Symbolic Intelligent Travel Planning System</strong><br>
    Independent Developer | Jul 2025 – Nov 2025<br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> Software Copyright (under application)<br>
    <em>Description:</em> Designed a neuro-symbolic decision-making system that integrates large language models with symbolic reasoning. The system accurately parses user free-form language to extract preferences and constraints, and performs interactive planning in a travel sandbox environment. Modules include itinerary scoring, optimal plan selection, time-zone and budget calculation, enabling personalized decision-making under multiple constraints. The neuro-symbolic planning mechanism balances feasibility and preference satisfaction, significantly improving the intelligence and reliability of travel planning.

    <strong>Cross-Modal Medical Polyp Segmentation Model</strong><br>
    Research Training Project | Participant | Sep 2025 – Dec 2025<br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> Completed model reproduction and improvement experiments with competitive results<br>
    <em>Description:</em> Participated in experimental research on a cross-modal medical polyp segmentation model based on an existing lab codebase. Focused on addressing insufficient long-range dependency modeling in the SAM2-UNet decoder by implementing a Global–Local collaborative Decoding (GLD) structure. Responsible for model training, comparative experiments, and result analysis. Conducted ablation and benchmark studies to evaluate segmentation performance, gaining hands-on experience with medical image segmentation pipelines, evaluation metrics, and engineering details.

    <strong>Multi-Agent Cooperation and Game-Theoretic Interaction Models</strong><br>
    Undergraduate Innovation & Entrepreneurship Project | Team Leader | Apr 2025 – Nov 2025<br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> One paper published in a national-level academic journal<br>
    <em>Description:</em> Studied multi-agent systems through literature review and paper reproduction, focusing on distributed collaboration, complex environment modeling, and parallel decision-making. On this basis, designed and implemented a prototype multi-agent cooperative system, exploring agent role assignment, collaboration mechanisms, and task workflows, providing an initial practical exploration of multi-agent cooperation and game-theoretic modeling.
