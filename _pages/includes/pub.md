    <strong>Wolf Game: Multi-Agent Cooperation and Adversarial System Based on ERNIE LLM</strong> <br>
    Team Leader | Jan 2025 – May 2025
    <br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> Software Copyright; National Third Prize, China Undergraduate Service Outsourcing Innovation & Entrepreneurship Competition
    <br>
    <em>Description:</em> Built an intelligent game platform for the Werewolf scenario using ERNIE large language model and the Swarm multi-agent framework. The system integrates natural language understanding with strategic decision-making to enable cooperation and confrontation among AI agents. I led the FastAPI backend architecture and strategy engine development, implemented a dual-layer agent persona design and complete game rule system, and participated in project management and technical decision-making, promoting AI applications in complex social reasoning environments.

    <strong>NeuroTrip: Neuro-Symbolic Intelligent Travel Planning System</strong> <br>
    Independent Developer | Jul 2025 – Nov 2025
    <br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> Software Copyright (under application)
    <br>
    <em>Description:</em> Designed a neuro-symbolic decision-making system that integrates large language models with symbolic reasoning. The system accurately parses user free-form language to extract preferences and constraints, and performs interactive planning in a travel sandbox environment. Modules include itinerary scoring, optimal plan selection, time-zone and budget calculation, enabling personalized decision-making under multiple constraints. The neuro-symbolic planning mechanism balances feasibility and preference satisfaction, significantly improving the intelligence and reliability of travel planning.

    <strong>Cross-Modal Medical Polyp Segmentation Model</strong> <br>
    Research Training Project | Participant | Sep 2025 – Dec 2025
    <br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> Completed model reproduction and improvement experiments with competitive results
    <br>
    <em>Description:</em> Participated in experimental research on a cross-modal medical polyp segmentation model based on an existing lab codebase. Focused on addressing insufficient long-range dependency modeling in the SAM2-UNet decoder by implementing a Global–Local collaborative Decoding (GLD) structure. Responsible for model training, comparative experiments, and result analysis. Conducted ablation and benchmark studies to evaluate segmentation performance, gaining hands-on experience with medical image segmentation pipelines, evaluation metrics, and engineering details.

    <strong>Multi-Agent Cooperation and Game-Theoretic Interaction Models</strong> <br>
    Undergraduate Innovation & Entrepreneurship Project | Team Leader | Apr 2025 – Nov 2025
    <br>
    <em>Achievements:</em> One paper published in a national-level academic journal
    <br>
    <em>Description:</em> Studied multi-agent systems through literature review and paper reproduction, focusing on distributed collaboration, complex environment modeling, and parallel decision-making. On this basis, designed and implemented a prototype multi-agent cooperative system, exploring agent role assignment, collaboration mechanisms, and task workflows, providing an initial practical exploration of multi-agent cooperation and game-theoretic modeling.
